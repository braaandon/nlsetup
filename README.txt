deprecated: whilst this still works, it hasnt been updated in over a year and is very feature lacking. i suggest you just patch the NetLimiter application instead to circumvent detection

usage tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a92fnI1cEh8

poorly made replacement frontend for NLClientApp.exe

requires netlimiter installed

ONLY TESTED WITH NETLIMITER 4.1.14.0
